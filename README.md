# Steps
1. Load OBJ File
   1. teapot.obj loads as text, so I just have it scan the text and output the amount of faces and vertices
   2. https://github.com/javagl/Obj
2. Compute Absolute Value

3. Compute the Distance between a Point and a Line in 3D

4. Determine whether a Line and a Triangle Intersect in 3D

5. Determine Which Faces from an OBJ File a Given Line Intersects With in 3D

6. Compute the Normal of a Triangle in 3D

7. Compute the Angle between Two Lines in 3D

8. Compute the Illumination for a Triangle in 3D

9. Raytrace an OBJ in 3D to Identify Illumination Intensities over a Screen of Pixels in 2D

10. Output Screen Pixels as an Image

11. A Main Function to Run the Program
    1. The main function being run loads a number of faces and vertices
